#  Task: Understanding VPNs for Privacy and Secure Communication  

##  Objective  
Understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in protecting online privacy and enabling secure communication.  

## Tools Used  
- Free VPN Client: **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)**   
- Website for IP check: [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com)  

##  Steps Followed  
1. **Choose VPN Service**  
   - Signed up for ProtonVPN Free Tier.  

2. **Download and Install**  
   - Installed the ProtonVPN desktop client on Windows.  

3. **Connect to VPN Server**  
   - Selected the nearest free server location.  
   - Successfully connected to VPN.  
   - *Screenshot: VPN Connection Status*  

4. **Verify IP Address Change**  
   - Checked IP before and after connecting using whatismyipaddress.com.  
   - IP address and location changed.  
   - *Screenshot: IP Address Verification*  

5. **Test Encrypted Traffic**  
   - Browsed multiple websites with VPN connected.  
   - Traffic confirmed as routed securely through the VPN server.  

6. **Disconnect and Compare**  
   - Disconnected VPN.  
   - Browsing speed was faster without VPN, and IP reverted to original.  

7. **Research on VPN Features**  
   - VPNs use encryption protocols like **AES-256**, **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, and **IKEv2**.  
   - They hide real IP address, mask location, and prevent ISP tracking.  
   - Provide additional security on public Wi-Fi networks.

##  Deliverables  
-  Screenshot of successful VPN connection  
-  Screenshot showing IP address change

##  VPN Benefits  
- Encrypts internet traffic to prevent eavesdropping.  
- Masks real IP address to enhance anonymity.  
- Secures data when using public Wi-Fi.  
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.  

---

##  VPN Limitations  
- Free versions may have limited server choices and reduced speed.  
- Some websites and services block VPN IP ranges.  
- VPN providers may log user data (depends on policy).  
- VPNs do not replace overall cybersecurity practices (e.g., antivirus, strong passwords).  

---

##  Summary  
VPNs play a critical role in maintaining **privacy, anonymity, and security** while browsing the internet.  
They encrypt communications, hide IP addresses, and protect against data interception—especially on unsafe networks.  
However, their effectiveness depends on the VPN provider’s trustworthiness and the limitations of free services.
